# Code Packages and Package Imports Path and Package Dependencies

## The init Functions

There can be multiple functions named as init declared in a package, even in a source code file. The functions names as init must have not any input parameters and return results.

At run time, each init function will be (sequentially) invoked once and only once (before invoking the main entry function).

## Resource Initialization Order

At run time, a package will be loaded after all its dependency packages. Each package will be loaded once and only once.
