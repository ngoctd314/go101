# How to write cleaning interface?

## Best practices for writing interfaces

**Keep interface small**

Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler 
The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction.

**Interfaces should have no knowledge of satisfying types**

The developer should have relied on the native functionality of type assertion to derive the underlying type

```go
type car interface {
    Color() string
    Speed() int
    // stupid
    IsFiretruck() bool
}
```

**Interface are not classes**
