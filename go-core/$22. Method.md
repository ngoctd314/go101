# Methods in Go

## Method Declarations

In Go, we can (explicitly) declare a method for type T and *T, where T must satisfy 4 conditions:

1. T must be a define type
2. T must be defined in the same package as the method declaration
3. T must not be a pointer type
4. T must not be an interface type.

## Each Method Corresponds to an Implicit Function

For each method declaration, compiler will declare a corresponding implicit function for it.

```go
func Book.Pages(b Book) int {
    return b.pages
}

func (*Book).SetPages(b *Book, pages int) {
    b.pages = pages
}
```

## Implicit Methods With Pointer Receivers

For each method declared for value receiver type T, a corresponding method will the same name will be implicitly declared by compiler for type *T.

```go
func (b *Book) Pages() int {
    return Book.Pages(*b)
}
```

## Method Prototypes and Method Sets

non-exported method names, which start with lower-case letters from different packages will be always viewed as two different method names, even if the two method names are the same in literal.

## Receiver Arguments Are Passed by Copy
