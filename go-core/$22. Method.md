# Methods in Go

## Method Declarations

In Go, we can (explicitly) declare a method for type T and *T, where T must satisfy 4 conditions:

1. T must be a define type
2. T must be defined in the same package as the method declaration
3. T must not be a pointer type
4. T must not be an interface type.
