# Interface

## Pointer dynamic value vs. non-pointer dynamic value

The official Go compiler/runtime makes an optimization which makes boxing pionter values into interface values more efficient than boxing non-pointer values. For large size values, the difference be not small. For the same optmization, type assertings with a pointer type are also more efficient that type assertions with the base type of the pointer type if the base type is a large size type.
