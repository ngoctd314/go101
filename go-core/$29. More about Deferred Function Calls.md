# More about Deferred function calls

## The evaluation moment of deferred function values

The called function (value) in a deferred function call is evaluated when the call is pushed into the deferred call stack of of the current goroutine.

## The evaluation moment of receiver arguments of deffered method calls

The arguments of a deferred function call are also evaluated before the deferred call is pushed into the deferred call stack of the current goroutine.

## Performance losses caused by deferreing function calls

A very large deferred call stack may also consume much memory, and the unexecuted deferred calls amy prevent some resources from being released in time. For example, if there are many files needed to be handled in a call to the following function, then a large number of file handlers will be not get released before the function exits.

```go
func writeManyFiles(files []File) error {
    for _, file := range files {
        f, err := os.Open(file.path)
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        defer f.Close()
        _, err = f.WriteString(file.content)
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        err = f.Sync()
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

For such cases, we can use an anonymous function to enclose the deferred calls so that the deferred function calls will get executed earlier.

```go
func writeManyFiles(files []File) error {
    for _, file := range files {
        if err := func() error {
            f, err := os.Open(file.path)
            if err != nil {
                return err
            }
            // The close method will be called at the end of the current loop step
            defer f.Close()

            _, err = f.WriteString(file.Content)
            if err != nil {
                return err
            }

            return f.Sync()
        }(); err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }

    return nil
}
```
