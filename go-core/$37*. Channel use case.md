# Channel use case

## Use channels as Futures/Promises

Futures and promises are used in many other popular languages. They are often associated with requests and responses.

### Return receive-only channels as results

In the following example, the values of two arguments of the sumSquares function call are requested concurrently. Each of the two channel receive operations will block until a send operation performs on the corresponding channel.

```go
func longTimeRequest() <-chan int32 {
	r := make(chan int32)

	go func() {
		// Simulate a workload
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 3)
		r <- rand.Int31n(100)
	}()

	return r
}

func sumSquares(a, b int32) int32 {
	return a*a + b*b
}

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

	a, b := longTimeRequest(), longTimeRequest()

	fmt.Println(sumSquares(<-a, <-b))
}

```

### Pass send-only channels as argument

```go
func longTimeRequest(r chan<- int32) {
	// Simulate a workload
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 3)
	r <- rand.Int31n(100)
}

func sumSquares(a, b int32) int32 {
	return a*a + b*b
}

func main() {
	now := time.Now()
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

	ra, rb := make(chan int32), make(chan int32)
	go longTimeRequest(ra)
	go longTimeRequest(rb)

	a, b := <-ra, <-rb
	fmt.Println(sumSquares(a, b), "after: ", time.Since(now))
}
```

## The first response wins

Sometimes, a piece of data can be received from several sources to avoid high latencies. To make the response duration as short as possible, we can send a request to every source in a separated goroutine. Only the first response will be used, other slower ones will be discarded.

Note, if there are N sources, the capacity of the communication channel must be at least N-1 to avoid the goroutines corresponding the discarded responses being blocked for ever.

```go
func send(c chan<- bool) {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
	r := rand.Int31n(10) + 1
	time.Sleep(time.Second * time.Duration(r))
	c <- true
}

func main() {
	now := time.Now()
	ch := make(chan bool, 500)
	for i := 0; i < 500; i++ {
		go send(ch)
	}
	<-ch
	fmt.Println("after: ", time.Since(now))
}
```

```go
func source(c chan<- int32) {
	rb := rand.Intn(3) + 1
	time.Sleep(time.Duration(rb) * time.Second)
	select {
	case c <- int32(rb):
	default:
	}
}

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
	// Please note, the capacity of the channel must be at least one, so that the first send won't be 
	// missed if the receiver/request side has not gotten ready in time.
	c := make(chan int32, 1)
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		go source(c)
	}
	rnd := <-c
	fmt.Println(rnd)
}
```

```go

```
## Use Channels for Notifications

Notifications can be viewed as special requests/responses in which the responded values are not important.

### 1-to-1 notification by sending, or receiving a value to a channel


```go
func main() {
	now := time.Now()
	done := make(chan struct{})

	go func() {
		// simulate work load
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)
		// send notification
		done <- struct{}{}
	}()

	<-done
	fmt.Println("After: ", time.Since(now))
}
```

### N-to-1 and 1-to-N notification

**N-to-1 notification**

```go
func main() {
	now := time.Now()

	wg := sync.WaitGroup{}

	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)

		go func() {
			// notifi ni -> 1
			defer wg.Done()
			// simulate workload
			time.Sleep(time.Second)
		}()
	}

	// block here
	wg.Wait()

	fmt.Println("after: ", time.Since(now))
}
```

**1-to-N notification**

We can close a channel to broadcast notifications. The feature that infinite values can be received from a closed channel will be utilized in many other use cases.

```go
func main() {
	now := time.Now()
	run := make(chan struct{})

	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		go func(i int) {
			// block here
			<-run
			fmt.Println("Run: ", i, " after: ", time.Since(now))
		}(i)
	}

	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	close(run)
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```

### Timer: scheduled notification

<- time.After(aDuration) will make the current goroutine enter blocking state, but time.Sleep(aDuration) function call will not. 

## Use Channels as Mutex Locks
