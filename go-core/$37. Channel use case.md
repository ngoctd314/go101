# Channel use case

## Use channels as Futures/Promises

Futures and promises are used in many other popular languages. They are often associated with requests and responses.

### Return receive-only channels as results

In the following example, the values of two arguments of the sumSquares function call are requested concurrently. Each of the two channel receive operations will block until a send operation performs on the corresponding channel.

```go
func longTimeRequest() <-chan int32 {
	r := make(chan int32)

	go func() {
		// Simulate a workload
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 3)
		r <- rand.Int31n(100)
	}()

	return r
}

func sumSquares(a, b int32) int32 {
	return a*a + b*b
}

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

	a, b := longTimeRequest(), longTimeRequest()

	fmt.Println(sumSquares(<-a, <-b))
}

```

### Pass send-only channels as argument
