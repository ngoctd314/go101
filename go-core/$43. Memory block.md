# Memory block

## Memory blocks

A memory block is a continuous memory segment to host value parts at run time. Different memory blocks may have different sizes, to host different value parts. One memory block may host multiple vlaue parts at the same time, but each value part can only be hosted within on memory block.

There are many reasons when one memory block may host multiple value parts. Some of them:
- A struct value often have several fields. So when a memory block is allocated for a struct value, the memory block will also host (the direct parts of) these field values.
- An array values. 
- The underlying element sequences of two slices may be hosted on the same memory block.

## When will memory blocks be allocated?
