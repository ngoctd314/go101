# Keywords and Identifiers in Go

## Keywords

Keywords are the special words which help compilers understand and parse user code.

- const, func, import, package, type and var are used to declare all kinds of code elements in Go programs
- chan, interface, map and struct are used as parts in some composite type denotations
- break, case, continue, default, else, fallthrough, for, goto, if range, return select and switch are used to control flow of code
- defer and go are also control flow keywords, but in other specific manners. They modify function calls

## Identifiers
