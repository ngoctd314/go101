# Pool

```go
type Pool struct {
    New func() any
}
```
Pool's purpose is to cache allocated but unused items for later reuse, relieving pressure on the garbage collector. That is, it makes it easy to build efficient, thread-safe free lists.

An appropriate use of a Pool is to manage a group of temporary items silently shared among and potentially reused by concurrent independent clients of a package. Pool provides a way to amortize allocation overhead aross many clients.

A Pool must not be copied after first use.

```go
func (*Pool) Get() any
```

Get selects an arbitrary item from the Pool, removes it from the Pool, and returns it to the caller. Get may choose to ignore the pool and treat is as empty. Callers should not assume any relation between values passed to Put and the values returned by Get.

```go
func (*Pool) Put(x any)
```
