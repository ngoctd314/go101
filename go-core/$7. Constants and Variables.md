# Constants and Variables

## Untyped Values and Typed Values

In Go, some values are untyped. An untyped value means the type of the value has not been confirmed yet. On the contrary, the type of a typed value is determined. The predeclared nil is the only untyped value which has no default type.

## Autocomplete in constant declarations

In a group-style constant declaration, execpt the first constant specification, other constant specifications can be incomplete. Compilers will autocomplete the incomplete lines for us by copying the missing part from the first preceding complete constant specification.

```go
const (
    X float32 = 3.14
    Y // Y float32 = 3.14
    Z // Y float32 = 3.14

    A, B = "Go", "language"
    C, _ // C, _ = "Go", "language"
)
```

## Value Addressability

In Go, some values are addressable (there is an address to find thme). All variables are addressable and all constants are undressable.

## Scopes of Variables and Named Constants

```go
package main

const y = 789
var x int = 123

func main() {
    // The x variable shadows the above declared
    // package-level variable
    var x = true
    {
        // Here, the left x and y are both new declared variable
        // The right ones are declared in outer blocks
        // x, y := x, y
        x, y := x, y
    }
}
```

## Each named constant identifier will be replaced with its bound literal value at compile time
