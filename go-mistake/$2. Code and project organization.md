## Unintended variable shadowing

In Go, a variable name declared in a block may be redeclared in an inner block. This principles, called variable shadowing, is prone to common mistakes.

```go
// stupid
var client *http.Client
if tracing {
    // client is shadowed (redeclared) in this block 
    client, err := createClientWithTracing()
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    log.Println(client)
}
// use client
```

```go
// solution
var client *http.Client 
if tracing {
    c, err := createClientWithTracing()
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    client = c
}
// use client
```
