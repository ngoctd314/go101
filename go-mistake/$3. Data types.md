## 3.10 Slice and memory leaks

This section will show that slicing an existing slice or array can lead to memory leaks in some conditions. We will discuss two cases: one case where the capacity is leaking and another related to pointers.

### 3.10.1 Capacity leak

### 3.10.2 Slice and pointers

We have seen that slicing can cause a leak because of the slice capacity. Yet, what about the elements? Those are still part of the backing array but outside the length range.
